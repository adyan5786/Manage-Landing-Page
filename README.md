## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Github Pages

### What I learned

I've learned the basics of Tailwind and how to deploy website onto Github Pages, since it's an entirely different process if the project is done with Tailwind CLI.

### Continued development

Tailwind CSS is currently one of the most popular and rapidly growing utility-first CSS frameworks. Perfecting Tailwind will be the goal as I continue to make more projects on it.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli) - Documentation for the installation and setup of Tailwind CLI for the development of the project. 
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Documentation for the deployment of the website using Github Pages. Didn't use it as much but still helpful for some parts of the deployment process.
